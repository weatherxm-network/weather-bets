# Weather Bets
This repository contains scripts and computations designed to resolve bets on the several platforms. It includes data processing and analysis tools to bets on various markets such as TrueMarkets.
For the purpose of resolving bets, the resolvers retrieve the sensor data from IPFS, perform the data filtering and the cryptographic proof validation and calculate the result based on the needs of each bet.

## Features
- H3 grid calculations for geospatial data
- Processing and filtering of large datasets that originate to IPFS
- Functions to compute and validate metrics for bets

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the experiment you wish.
3. Setup properly the required env variables
4. Run the experiment: `docker-compose up`

## Usage
Run the main script with your desired parameters to initiate computations.

For more details, refer to the documentation within the repository.
